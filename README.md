## Intro to computational languages and programming for UBC life sciences trainees

This public repository is my response to translate some of what I learned over the last year into a resource for others who may benefit from this page as a starting point to learning about which coding languages and environments are right for them.

When I began my MSc. in Medical Genetics at UBC in 2020, I had no idea what a coding language was; I vaguely know about R and Python, but if you were to ask me what the command line was - and distinguishing Bash script from R script - I would've been at a total loss. (Hence why I came to do this degree in the first place, to learn how to design and execute a completely computational genetics project, after years of wet lab and clinical experience.)

I would have appreciated some kind of direction a page directed at motivated learners who don't know where to start - with the context of being a UBC graduate student, per UBC resources mentioned in this repository - and some guide to help contextualize which coding languages were important and relevant to my work, why, and getting my feet on the ground so I could properly self-teach and know what kind of resources to seek out, and where. 

Of course, every trainee has a different background, thesis project and supervisory expectations of their output - but at the end of the day, we're all generating data, and we all have a responsibility to conduct and present out analyses with methods that are as transparent and reproducible as possible.

Whether you're a researcher at the bench working on model systems, animal models, or even completely computational, I hope this repository helps.

I welcome feedback at any time if you would like to add resouces to any of the pages.
