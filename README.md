## Intro to computational languages and programming for UBC life sciences trainees

As I was beginning my MSc. in Medical Genetics at UBC in 2020, I would have appreciated this kind of introduction to contextualize which coding languages were important and relevant to my work, why, what I needed to learn (and what was "fluff"), and just getting familiar with the key resources available.

Of course, every trainee has a different background, thesis project and supervisory expectations of their output - but at the end of the day, we're all generating data, and we all have a responsibility - as scientists - to conduct and present out analyses with methods that are as transparent and reproducible as possible.

Whether you're a researcher at the bench working on model systems, animal models, or even completely computational, I hope this repository helps.
