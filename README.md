## Attn grad students gathering and analyzing data! 

Do you have no idea if coding is right for you and your data?

Do you want to learn how to analyze your data quickly and efficiently, create beautiful publication-quality plots?

Do you have no idea where to start?

This public repository is my response to translate some of what I learned over the last year into a resource for others who may benefit from this page as a starting point to learning about which coding languages and environments are right for them.

Of course, every trainee has a different background, thesis project and supervisory expectations of their output - but at the end of the day, we're all generating data, and we all have a responsibility to conduct and present out analyses with methods that are as transparent and reproducible as possible.

Whether you're a researcher at the bench working on model systems, animal models, or even completely computational, I hope this repository helps.
