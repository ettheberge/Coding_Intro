## Are you a trainee collecting and analyzing data?

Do you have no idea if coding is right for you regarding your analysis plans? 

Do you want to learn how to analyze and conduct statistical analyses on your data quickly and efficiently? 

Do you want to create beautiful publication-quality plots?

**But:** Do you have no idea where to start?

The purpose of this repository is to translate some of what I've learned in the last year to other students who may be feeling just as lost as I was. I hope that you, the reader, can benefit from this collection of resources as a starting point to learn the "ABC"s of coding vocabulary and to distinguish which coding languages and environments are right for them.

Of course, every trainee has a different background, thesis project and supervisory expectations of their output - but at the end of the day, we're all generating data, and we all have a responsibility to conduct and present out analyses with methods that are as transparent and reproducible as possible, no matter what kind of research we are conducting.

**Which language is for me?**

Do some Googling of what kind of work you're doing and what others say; R? Python? C++? Matlab? Look at papers to find out what your field uses to conduct their analyses. For me (the writer), I use bash script (on the command line) and R (in RStudio) for my working with big genomics data and wrangling large datasets with a mix of qualitative and quantitative metadata. Among my colleagues, I usually hear that R is preferred as the "first" language, however eventually moving to Bash script/familiarity with the command line may be required!
