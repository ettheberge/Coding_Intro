## Are you a graduate student gathering and analyzing data?

Do you have no idea if coding is right for you and what you want to do with your data?

Do you want to learn how to analyze and conduct statistical analyses on your data quickly and efficiently? 

Do you want to create beautiful publication-quality plots?

**But:** Do you have no idea where to start?

The purpose of this repository is to translate some of what I've learned in the last year to other students who may be feeling just as lost as I was. I hope that you, the reader, can benefit from this collection of resources as a starting point to learn the "ABC"s of coding vocabulary and to distinguish which coding languages and environments are right for them.

Of course, every trainee has a different background, thesis project and supervisory expectations of their output - but at the end of the day, we're all generating data, and we all have a responsibility to conduct and present out analyses with methods that are as transparent and reproducible as possible, no matter what kind of research we are conducting.
