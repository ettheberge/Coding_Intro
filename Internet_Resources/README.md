**General**

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is THE forum where someone's probably asked the exact same question you've had. So much of my steep learning curve has just been Googling a ton of "how to do __ " and being directed to a thread in Stack.


**R/Statistics**

[The STHDA website](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials) is my #1 go-to for anything to do with R/ggplot2 for making every type of plot. Requires the `ggplot` library to be installed. I also recommend looking into `ggpubr` for making publication-quality plots. 

[Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) - Honestly, just do everything in the tidyverse. It'll make your life so much easier. 

[Intro to the field of statistics (and R)](https://stat150.blog/) is a non-UBC course (all materials on the site) I wish I could've self-taught from sooner. Very helpful resource that compliments UBC's STAT 545/540 (I would go through this course-->545-->540.)

[Marin lectures: Statistics in R](https://www.statslectures.com/) - This series is a+. I always go back to it.

[Statquest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) - Also incredible for explaining statistical concepts. Doesn't contextualize in R, though, but that can be fixed with a quick Google. (ie "how do do logistic regression in R" hint: `glm`)


**Command Line: Bash Shell script**

[Ryan's tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) - Honestly my #1 go-to for Bash-related intro tutorials.

[Bash shell cheat sheet](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet) - Speaks for itself.

[Introduction to Bash (Shell) and Manipulating Files and Directores at the Command Line](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/) - Helpful starter.
