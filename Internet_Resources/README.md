This page is to supplement the great resources at UBC (ie. STAT 540 and 545) [here](https://github.com/ettheberge/Coding_Intro/tree/main/UBC_groups_resources).

## General

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - THE forum where someone's probably asked the exact same question you've had. So much of my steep learning curve has just been Googling a ton of "how to do __ " and being directed to a thread in Stack.

[Bioconductor](https://support.bioconductor.org/) - A helpful forum for genomics-specific questions.

## R/Statistics

[The Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) - Honestly, I can't recommend enough how much to start early/ do everything in the tidyverse. It'll make your life so much easier.   

[Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) - Part of the tidyverse, very important set of functions for data wrangling!

[The STHDA website](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials) - My #1 go-to for anything to do with R/ggplot2 for making every type of plot. `ggplot2` is under the tidyverse. I also recommend looking into `ggpubr` for making publication-quality plots. 

[Intro to the field of statistics (and R)](https://stat150.blog/) - A non-UBC course (all materials on the site) that I wish I could've self-taught from sooner. Very helpful resource that compliments UBC's STAT 545/540 (I would go through this course-->545-->540.)

[Marin lectures: Statistics in R](https://www.statslectures.com/) - This series is a+. I always go back to it.

[Statquest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) - Also incredible for explaining statistical concepts. Doesn't contextualize in R, though, but that can be fixed with a quick Google. (ie "how do do logistic regression in R" hint: `glm`)

## Command Line: Bash Shell script

[What is the difference between UNIX, Linux, Bash, Zsh, shell programming, and shell scripting? What is meant by the word "shell"?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-UNIX-Linux-Bash-Zsh-shell-programming-and-shell-scripting-What-is-meant-by-the-word-shell)

[Ryan's tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) - My go-to for bash scripting.

[UNIX tutorial for beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) -  Similar to ^, also a staple.

[Bash shell cheat sheet](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet) - Speaks for itself.

[UNIX cheat sheet](http://squirrel.sr.unh.edu/~jraeder/795895/uploads/UNIXCheatSheet.pdf) - Also speaks for itself.

[Introduction to Bash (Shell) and Manipulating Files and Directores at the Command Line](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/) - Helpful starter to Bash.

## Twitter threads: A bit of everything

[Dr. Michael Hoffman: "Folks with mainly biology training sometimes ask me for resources that can help them learn bioinformatics. This short thread has my recommendations at various levels."](https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman/status/1407143481479503873?s=21&fbclid=IwAR0as1P-vEFRwYV8weXYXwTLjD8AAvQO_F_YPWHVsgNZzBXpklE0Ut-IAWI)
