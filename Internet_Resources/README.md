This page is to supplement the great resources at UBC (ie. STAT 540 and 545) [here](https://github.com/ettheberge/Coding_Intro/tree/main/UBC_groups_resources).

## General

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - THE forum where someone's probably asked the exact same question you've had. So much of my steep learning curve has just been Googling a ton of "how to do __ " and being directed to a thread in Stack.

[Bioconductor](https://support.bioconductor.org/) - A helpful forum for genomics-specific questions.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) - Many free courses on a variety of relevant topics to this page. For example:
- Coursera: [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming), [Getting & Cleaning data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning), [Exploratory data analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis) 
- Datacamp: [R, Python, Shell, Git... Many courses to choose from!](https://www.datacamp.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&tab=courses&facets%5Btechnology%5D%5B%5D=R&facets%5Btechnology%5D%5B%5D=Python&facets%5Btechnology%5D%5B%5D=Shell)

## R/Statistics

[Intro to the field of statistics (and R)](https://stat150.blog/) - A non-UBC course (all materials on the site) that I wish I could've self-taught from sooner. Very helpful resource that compliments UBC's STAT 545/540 (I would go through this course-->545-->540.)

[Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) - A textbook-style introduction to R.

[RMarkdown link 1](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) and [link 2](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) - What we use to document our code and make nice reports.

[RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - Speaks for itself. As all of your work in R is in RStudio, worth taking a look! 

[Marin lectures: Statistics in R](https://www.statslectures.com/) - This series is a+. I always go back to it.

[Statquest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) - Also incredible for explaining statistical concepts. Doesn't contextualize in R, though, but that can be fixed with a quick Google. (ie "how do do logistic regression in R" hint: `glm`)

[Handbook of Biological Statistics](http://www.biostathandbook.com/) - A really useful online textbook that covers pretty much all of it.

[The Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) - Honestly, I can't recommend enough how much to start early/ do everything in the tidyverse. It'll make your life so much easier.   

[Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) - Part of the tidyverse, very important set of functions for data wrangling! [Here's another dplyr page.]( https://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial)

[The STHDA website](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials) - My #1 go-to for anything to do with R/ggplot2 for making every type of plot. `ggplot2` is under the tidyverse. I also recommend looking into the supplemental packages `ggpubr` and/or `cowplot` for making publication-quality figures. 

[R-statistics.co](http://r-statistics.co/) - Has many useful tutorials and pages for analysis in R, including an R tutorial, some very comprehensive ggplot2 tutorials, and tutorials on various statistical analyses.

## Bash/UNIX

[What is the difference between UNIX, Linux, Bash, Zsh, shell programming, and shell scripting? What is meant by the word "shell"?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-UNIX-Linux-Bash-Zsh-shell-programming-and-shell-scripting-What-is-meant-by-the-word-shell)

[Ryan's tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) - My go-to for bash scripting.

[UNIX tutorial for beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) -  Similar to ^, also a staple.

[Bash shell cheat sheet](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet) - Speaks for itself.

[UNIX cheat sheet](http://squirrel.sr.unh.edu/~jraeder/795895/uploads/UNIXCheatSheet.pdf) - Also speaks for itself.

[Introduction to Bash (Shell) and Manipulating Files and Directores at the Command Line](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/) - Helpful starter to Bash.

## Twitter threads: A bit of everything

[I made a whole page for these](https://github.com/ettheberge/Coding_Intro/blob/main/Internet_Resources/Twitter_Resources.md)
